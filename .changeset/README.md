# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with monorepos to help you version and publish packages.

## How to add a changeset

1. Run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository.
2. Select the packages you want to include in the changeset.
3. Choose the version bump type (major, minor, patch).
4. Write a summary of the change.

A new markdown file will be created in this directory. Commit it along with your changes.

When a release is ready, run `pnpm version-packages` to consume all changesets and update package versions and changelogs, then `pnpm release` to publish.
