# Cursor Rules — Browsecraft

# 🚨 SYSTEM OVERRIDE 🚨
# READ THE FULL RULEBOOK: AGENTS.md (root of this repo)
# This file is a strict pointer — all rules are documented in AGENTS.md.
# YOU WILL FAIL YOUR DIRECTIVE IF YOU DO NOT COMPLY WITH THIS.

# MANDATORY: Before every commit AND every push, run EXACTLY THIS COMMAND:
#   pnpm build && pnpm lint && node tests/unit/run-all.mjs && node tests/smoke.mjs
# 
# (6/6 packages compile, 0 lint errors, ALL unit tests pass, ALL smoke tests pass)
# Unit tests alone are NOT enough. Smoke tests catch real browser bugs. If you do not run this, you are violating the core directive.

# KEY RULES:
# - No `any` types (use proper types or biome-ignore with justification)
# - LF line endings only (never CRLF)
# - Template literals only (no string concatenation)
# - Root tsconfig.json has "types": ["node"] — do NOT remove
# - Build before testing (tests import from dist/)
# - Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:
# - NEVER push git tags manually — let CI handle it
# - Tests go in tests/unit/*.test.mjs

# MONOREPO: 6 packages (browsecraft, browsecraft-ai, browsecraft-bdd,
#   browsecraft-bidi, browsecraft-runner, create-browsecraft)
# BUILD: pnpm + Turborepo + tsup (ESM + CJS + DTS)
# LINT: Biome 1.9+ (tabs, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas)
# NODE: >= 20.0.0
