# Cursor Rules — Browsecraft

# READ THE FULL RULEBOOK: AGENTS.md (root of this repo)
# This file is a pointer — all rules are documented in AGENTS.md.

# MANDATORY: Before every commit, run:
#   pnpm build                    (6/6 packages must compile)
#   pnpm lint                     (0 errors, 0 warnings)
#   node tests/unit/run-all.mjs   (all suites pass)

# KEY RULES:
# - No `any` types (use proper types or biome-ignore with justification)
# - LF line endings only (never CRLF)
# - Template literals only (no string concatenation)
# - Root tsconfig.json has "types": ["node"] — do NOT remove
# - Build before testing (tests import from dist/)
# - Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, docs:, chore:
# - NEVER push git tags manually — let CI handle it
# - Tests go in tests/unit/*.test.mjs

# MONOREPO: 6 packages (browsecraft, browsecraft-ai, browsecraft-bdd,
#   browsecraft-bidi, browsecraft-runner, create-browsecraft)
# BUILD: pnpm + Turborepo + tsup (ESM + CJS + DTS)
# LINT: Biome 1.9+ (tabs, single quotes, semicolons, trailing commas)
# NODE: >= 20.0.0
